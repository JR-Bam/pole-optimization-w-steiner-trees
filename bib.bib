abstract = {We present a new implementation of the Kou, Markowsky and Berman algorithm for finding a Steiner tree for a connected, undirected distance graph with a specified subset S of the set of vertices V. The total distance of all edges of this Steiner tree is at most 2(1-1/l) times that of a Steiner minimal tree, where l is the minimum number of leaves in any Steiner minimal tree for the given graph. The algorithm runs in O(|E|+|V|log|V|) time in the worst case, where E is the set of all edges and V the set of all vertices in the graph.},
